# Architecture Document for Communities Squared (C2)

This document describes the technical approach and conceptual structure for Communities Squared (C2), focusing on a microservices framework to ensure scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. It serves as a blueprint for building the platform's architecture.

## Technical Approach

### Planned Tech Stack

1. **Frontend**:
   - **Framework**: React.js for dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
   - **State Management**: Redux for managing complex application states.
   - **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for fast, utility-first styling.
   - **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.

2. **Backend** (Microservices Architecture):
   - **Framework**: Node.js with Express.js for building lightweight and scalable services.
   - **Database**: PostgreSQL for both structured and semi-structured data.
   - **Service Communication**: gRPC for high-performance inter-service communication.
   - **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous task handling and decoupling services.
   - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 and JWT for secure authentication and authorization.
   - **Testing**: Mocha and Chai for backend unit and integration testing.

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - **Cloud Provider**: AWS for hosting, with EC2 for computation, S3 for storage, and RDS for database hosting.
   - **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
   - **Containerization**: Docker for creating isolated and reproducible service environments.
   - **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for managing and scaling containerized services.
   - **Local Hosting**: Docker Compose for running and testing the full microservices architecture locally.

4. **Third-Party Integrations**:
   - **Collaboration Tools**: Integration with Slack for notifications and updates.
   - **Marketplace**: Stripe API for payment processing and monetization features.
   - **Analytics**: Mixpanel for user behavior tracking and insights.

5. **Security**:
   - End-to-end encryption for sensitive data.
   - Regular vulnerability scanning with OWASP ZAP.
   - Role-based access control (RBAC) for permissions management.

## Conceptual Structure (Microservices Framework)

### 1. **Core Services**

#### **Collaboration Service**
- **Purpose**: Manages idea proposals, collaboration sessions, and feedback.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /ideas`: Submit new ideas.
  - `GET /ideas/{id}`: Retrieve details of an idea.
  - `POST /feedback`: Submit feedback on ideas.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured idea data.

#### **Marketplace Service**
- **Purpose**: Handles resource listings, transactions, and provider reviews.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /listings`: Create a new marketplace listing.
  - `GET /listings`: Retrieve available resources.
  - `POST /transactions`: Process payments securely.
- **Message Broker**: Communicates with the notification service to inform users of marketplace activities.

#### **Governance Service**
- **Purpose**: Enables decentralized decision-making and community voting.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /votes`: Submit a new vote for a proposal.
  - `GET /audit-logs`: Retrieve governance decisions and their outcomes.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for audit logs and vote tracking.
- **Blockchain Integration (Future)**: Transparent and immutable storage of votes and decisions.

#### **User Management Service**
- **Purpose**: Handles user authentication, roles, and profiles.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /login`: Authenticate users.
  - `POST /register`: Register new users.
  - `GET /profile`: Retrieve user profile details.
- **Security**: Implements OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication flows.

#### **Notification Service**
- **Purpose**: Sends real-time notifications and updates to users.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /notifications`: Send notifications.
  - `GET /notifications`: Retrieve notification history.
- **Communication**: Uses WebSockets for real-time updates and email for asynchronous alerts.

---

### 2. **Service Communication**
- **API Gateway**:
  - Acts as the single entry point for all external requests.
  - Handles request routing, load balancing, and authentication.
- **Inter-Service Communication**:
  - **gRPC**: Efficient, low-latency protocol for inter-service communication.
  - **RabbitMQ**: Reliable message queue for asynchronous task execution, such as sending notifications or processing payments.

---

### 3. **Scalability and Maintainability**

#### Scalability
- **Database Scaling**: Use read replicas and sharding for PostgreSQL to handle high data loads.
- **Service Auto-Scaling**: Kubernetes automatically adjusts service instances based on traffic.
- **Content Delivery Network (CDN)**: Serve static assets globally to reduce latency.

#### Maintainability
- **Modular Services**: Each service is self-contained, making it easy to update or replace without impacting the entire system.
- **Observability**: Implement logging (Elastic Stack) and monitoring (Prometheus and Grafana) to track performance and detect issues.
- **Standardized APIs**: Use OpenAPI specifications for consistent and clear documentation.

### 4. **Future Components**

#### AI-Powered Recommendations
- Suggest collaborators, resources, or tools based on user activity and project needs.

#### Blockchain Governance
- Explore blockchain integration for secure, transparent voting and decision-making.

#### Mobile Applications
- Native mobile apps for iOS and Android to improve accessibility and engagement.
